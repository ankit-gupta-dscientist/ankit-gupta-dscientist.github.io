What I would do differently: 
I would perhaps look at models that have less computational load, as we have found with this automation, it takes a long time to process the many models and their variants.
I would also perhaps pick another model than SVM. SVM has trouble with computation for one of subgroups, probably since there was a lot of noise and data in the training set

Most difficult part:
Difficult part was actually the preprocessing and making sure we had the data in the right format as well as troubleshooting out final automated product.
The final automation required us to understand like processing limitations for some of the tasks outlined.

Big-Takeaways:
Figure out ways to optimize your solution for the resources you have, in this case computation power and time.
Explore less common variations of models to better fit a diagnosis to the problem.
