## Third Blog Post ST558

In this blog post, we'll discuss how to determine which variables to include in your regression model and explore some variable selection techniques to guide your journey.

You need to carefully select the right pieces (variables) and arrange them in a way that makes sense


Before diving into variable selection, it's essential to thoroughly understand your dataset. 

Some questions to ask: 

What is the nature of the problem? Is it a prediction or explanation task?
Are there any domain-specific insights that suggest which variables might be relevant?
How much data is available, and are there any missing values?

Methods I recommend:

Lasso and Ridge Regression: Regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge are my go-to methods for variable selection when dealing with high-dimensional data. They effectively handle multicollinearity and automatically shrink less relevant variables.

Information Criteria: I often use AIC and BIC to assess the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit. These criteria help me find a balance between accuracy and model simplicity.
