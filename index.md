      My project was around analyzing different parameters around different Pokemon. Pokemon is a Japanese Media Franchise starting in 1997 which became largely popular for its tv series and card trading game.
      
      The goal of my project is inform individuals how to utilize historical information around this Pokemon using the Poke API.
      
      I looked at many different facets but focused my visualizations around the physical capability and measurements of these pokemon.
      
      An interesting finding was the sheer greatness of legendary pokemon in the dataset!

      Programming-wise, I learned how to make a 3-D scatterplot, and how to mass appropriate api data into cuts of usable insights. Attempted to load this into git (github_page upload alongside hoping for MD file to populate). Unfortunately could not troubleshoot. In the future, I would sure up my github page reading more on how to troubleshoot. I would also like to try to create my own api through a database, think that would be interesting!
