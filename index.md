Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the compass that guides data scientists through the dense forest of raw data to uncover valuable insights and patterns. 
Its often the first step in any data-driven project, and like any art, it gets better with practice

EDA is both an art and a science. 
Its about discovering the hidden stories within the data, asking the right questions, and letting the data lead you to its secrets. 

Some techniques I like to use initially to make more sense of data:



Summary Statistics

Basic statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance provide an initial overview of the datas central tendency and dispersion.

Data Visualization

Histograms Visualize the distribution of a single variable.
Box Plots Show the summary of a variables distribution, including outliers.
Scatter Plots Examine relationships between two variables.
Etc

Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) to understand the relationships between variables. Positive, negative, or no correlation can provide insights into dependencies.

Outlier Detection

Use statistical techniques (e.g., Z-scores, IQR) to identify and handle outliers, which can skew analysis.
