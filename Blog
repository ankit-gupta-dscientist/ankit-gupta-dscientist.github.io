Being a data scientist involves working with data to extract valuable insights and solve complex problems.  
Their main goal is to derive meaningful conclusions from data and use those insights to drive informed decisions and strategies. Data scientists focus on extracting insights from data to solve real-world problems and often use machine learning techniques. 
Statisticians are more concentrated on designing experiments, developing statistical methodologies, and drawing conclusions from data.Data scientists often need domain expertise to understand the context of the data and the implications of their findings, whereas statisticians might focus more on the mathematical and theoretical aspects of statistics.
